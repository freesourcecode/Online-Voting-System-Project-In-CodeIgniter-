# Online Voting System Project in CodeIgniter with Source Code
The **Online Voting System Project in CodeIgniter** is primarily concerned with voting, including candidates, voters, and so on.

Additionally, the system displays all accessible voting data, including vote counts, voters, and non-voters. 

The **Voting System in CodeIgniter** also allows you to manage candidates by adding their name, slogan, and photo.

Admin Panel and Voters Panel are the two sections of the project. In this web application‚Äôs overview, the administrator has complete control over the system.

The administrator has the authority to handle each and every candidate as well as the voting process. 

An administrator must create a title and choose available candidates before organizing voting.

The system has various validations in place, such as requiring the administrator to select multiple applicants in order to progress. The administrator must create voter accounts by supplying a name and a login.

## What is CodeIgniter?

**CodeIgniter** is an Application Development Framework ‚Äì a toolset ‚Äì for PHP web site developers.

Its purpose is to let you construct projects much faster than if you were programming code from start by providing a rich set of libraries for common activities, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries.

By reducing the amount of code required for a given operation, CodeIgniter allows you to focus more creatively on your project.

An **Online Voting System in CodeIgniter** isn‚Äôt complete without a panel of voters who can cast votes according to their preferences. 

The default password for each voter panel will be the same as their usernames for voter login. 

When voters initially log in, the system prompts them to update their password before proceeding.

The system redirects the user to the voting panel as soon as the user changes his or her password. The voter will be able to see current voting with titles and their respective candidates within the voting panel. 

Voters will be able to vote for any of the candidates, and the system will ask for confirmation before submitting their vote.

Within two minutes of casting a vote, a voter is automatically logged out. 

The voter will then be unable to vote in the same election. These validations aid in the prevention of duplicate votes from the same account.
